# Intro 
I was on trying to find a great mango chicken recipe. 
So I read a few recipes and found out that they are mostly identical. The biggest difference seemed to be the used curry paste.
Some used a _Korma_ style paste whereas others used a _Tikka Masala_.
I decided to prepare both pastes and just cook the same mango chicken recipe twice simultaneously and find out what I like better.

# Korma 
Korma is a mild paste with an almond and coconut taste to it. Perfect for those who don't like their dishes to be spicy.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt
* 2 gloves of garlic
* piece of ginger (thumb-sized)
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 2 tablespoons of oil (e.g. groundnut)
* 1 tablespoon tomate puree
* 1 fresh green chili
* 3 tablespoons dried coconut
* 2 tablespoons ground almonds
* 15g fresh coriander
* 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, toasted

# Tikka Masala 
Tikka Masala is a slightly more spicy paste and has much less coconut to it compared to the korma paste.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt
* 2 gloves of garlic
* piece of ginger (thumb-sized)
* 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
* 2 teaspoon garam masala
* 2 tablespoons of oil (e.g. groundnut)
* 2 tablespoon tomato puree
* 2 fresh red chili
* 15g fresh coriander
* 1 tablespoons dried coconut
* 2 tablespoons ground almonds
* 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, toasted

# Process
The process for the two pastes is similar, first toast the coriander seeds in a dry pan on medium heat for a couple of minutes until they smell deliciously.
Peel ginger and garlic and cut them and the chili(s) in small pieces.

* Use a mortar to grind the roasted seeds
* Add the coarse sea salt and the fresh coriander. The coarse salt helps to grind the fresh coriander
* Add the garlic and the garam masala
* Add the ginger and rest of the spices
* Add the ground almonds
* Add the tomato paste and the oil
* Add the chili pieces
* Add the dried coconut

_For the lazy ones_: You can also put all the ingredients in a food processor and let it run until you have a smooth paste.
But where is the fun with that?
